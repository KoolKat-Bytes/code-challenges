# Vision of the future
You wish to join the Time Brigade, an elite team composed only of meta-humans capable of seeing into the future. By gathering the best meta-humans, the Brigade is of great help in anticipating certain events that are harmful to Humanity and the Planet, foreseeing them and proposing optimal solutions even before they happen.

The Brigade is composed of 4 Orders: Foresight, Innovation, Wisdom and Protection. Today is the big day: after months of preparation, you will take the final exam to join the Order of Protection. You will have to show that you are a meta-human, and one of the best. The test room is pitch black, and for good reason: your test is to improve the visibility of the city's nighttime signage, to make it suitable for the visually impaired. The officer in charge of testing asks you to propose a more legible version of each sign. A simple but effective idea comes to mind when you see the signs: by reversing the colors, the sign will be much more readable. Each panel is composed of 2 colors, represented in input by 2 different capital letters. Write a program that reverses the colors of the sign.

# Data
## Input
**Line 1 :** a string of characters between 2 and 15, representing the sign to be updated. The string is composed of 2 uppercase letters, representing the 2 distinct colors of the sign.

## Output
Your program will have to return on the standard output a character string corresponding to the input string whose 2 colors have been swapped.

# Examples
| **Input**  | **Expected output** |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| RGGR       | GRRG                |
| XXXXO      | OOOOX               |
| AB         | BA                  |
