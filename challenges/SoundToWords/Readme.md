# From Sound to Words
After demonstrating your ability to discern the future, you are already     assigned your first mission! The first person you'll be helping is an elderly man who is going to get lost in the forest in the next few hours. How do you know where he's going to get lost and send a rescue team right away? You hear something in your vision! The poor man is trying to send a text message on a device from another time, but you can't see his screen clearly. The phone is clearly too old to be of any use nowadays... But you are sure that if you concentrate, you will be able to find the message just from the sound of the keyboard! Write a program that finds the message from the sound of the keys to save the sailor!

## Data
### Input
*Line 1*: A sequence of characters containing only numbers from **0** to **9** and spaces.\
The messages are typed on a standard telephone keypad (see image below): a quick press of the 1 key produces an **a**, 2 presses of the 1 key produce a **b**, 3 produce a **c**. Note that a press on the 0 key produces a space. A silence between two characters is represented in the input by a space.

### Output
The translated message (all letters are in lower case).\
The message contains at most 200 words, and contains only letters from **a** to **z** and spaces.

## Example
For the input :
